### Unique gift ideas based on lifestyle.

<p>Giftlister recommends unique gifts for the hard-to-buy-for people in your life. Anyone can browse giftlistr's product listings by category, but users with accounts have access to giftlists where they can save gift ideas for a specific person.</p>

<p>Next I want to connect the Facebook Graph API and use the data on a user's friends list to return gift recommendations.</p>
