### Unique gift ideas based on lifestyle. 

<p> Giftlister uses the Etsy API to recommend unique gifts for the hard-to-buy-for people in your life. Anyone can browse giftlistr's product listings by category, but users with accounts have access to giftlists where they can save gift ideas for a specific person. </p>

<p>If I have time, I want to connect the Facebook Graph API and use the data on a user's friends list to return more accurate gift recommendations.</p>
